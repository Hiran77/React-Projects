Lifting the state up : 

const App = () => {
  const [expenses, setExpenses] = useState(DUMMY_EXPENSES);

  const addExpenseHandler = (expense) => {
    setExpenses((prevExpenses) => {
      return [expense, ...prevExpenses];
    });
  };

Here we are using the list as a common pattern in the parent component.
